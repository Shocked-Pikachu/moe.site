# Bach's Cantatas (康塔塔) and Passions (受难曲)

**Bach's vocal music is actual church music.**

Cantata 就是一个多乐章的管弦乐曲+声乐曲

<font color=blue>*Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit*, BWV 106</font>

Chorale (材料) Opera (风格) Concerto (曲式) Fugue (技巧)

> "In Bach's overtly religious vocal music we shall see Bach's religious **contempt for the world** was often communicated through the outward forms of **secular entertainment**."

世俗歌曲：Opera, Concerto

巴赫会用到歌剧的材料融入到他的宗教性的大型声乐作品当中（但是巴赫一生都没有写过一部歌剧）

> "Traditionally, Lutheran church music had been based on **chorales**. By the 1680s a Lutheran 'oratorio' style had been developed, in which chorales alternated with biblical verses and with little poems that reflected emotionally on the verses the way arias reflected on the action in an *opera seria*."

巴赫写的康塔塔类似于亨德尔写的清唱剧，但是康塔塔的是宗教性的，而亨德尔的清唱剧是世俗的（只不过里面会用到宗教的素材）

康塔塔：<font color=red>Cantatas were reflective, not dramatic works.</font> The singers of the arias were not characters but disembodied persons who 'voiced' the idealized thoughts of the congregation in response to the occasion that had brought them together.The <font color=red><u>Lutheran cantata</u></font> could be viewed as a sort of musical sermon, and its placement in the service confirms this analogy.

有趣的是亨德尔的清唱剧是世俗的，但是由于各种原因，他的清唱剧（如《弥赛亚》）在现在成为了宗教乐曲，并且经常在圣诞节这种时候在教堂被演奏。而巴赫的康塔塔是宗教的，但是由于里面包含的世俗的元素，在现在成为了（世俗的）音乐会曲目

<font color=blue>*Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland*, BWV 62</font>

虽然每一首康塔塔的结构都不一样，但是一定会用四部的众赞歌合唱（Chorale: Four-Part Harmonization）做结尾

<font color=blue>*Ein' feste Burg*, BWV 80</font>

这里面的声部多到以当时的条件没有办法演奏出来！反人性？

> "Bach's settings are pervaded with a general **anti-humanism** such as we encountered in the Brandenburg Concertos, with their implied religiously motivated contempt for human hierarchies and power relations. The contempt is much more overt in the cantatas and shows up precisely in Bach's seeming **<u>unconcern for practical performance considerations</u>**. A work like Cantata no. 80, plausibly beyond the capabilities of the performers to whom it was perforce assigned, could be looked upon as **'idealistic' in this sense, deliberately contriving a splendor and suggesting a perfection beyond terrestrial accomplishment**."

Bach's church music sometimes is about 'truth' instead of 'beauty'.

<font color=blue>*Meine Seufzer, meine Tränen* ("My sighs, my tears"), BWV 13</font>

描述人悲伤情绪的时候，旋律就不太好听

<font color=blue>*Du Hirte Israel, höre*, BWV 104</font>

给歌手的换气口很少，歌手在唱的时候难以喘气

> "**Undermining human agency** is something that Bach engineers again and again. Unlike Handel's music, Bach's church music serves the purposes of the performers with a dilemma: either adapt the performance to the tastes of the modern secular audience whether by modernizing the performing forces, for example, or by <font color=red>'secularizing'</font> the tempos or the general demeanor) and risk losing the full force of the expressive message encoded in the music, or perform the music in an appropriate manner and risk perplexing, fatiguing, or even insulting the audience. This is why only a handful of Bach's cantatas can be said to have really joined the modern performance repertory, and thoroughly unrepresentative handful at that."

为了能够让巴赫的音乐符合现代人在音乐厅中的审美，势必做出了一些“世俗化”的调整

<font color=blue>Bach's B minor Mass, BWV 232</font>

整首弥撒曲是用拉丁文写作的（不是马丁路德教而像天主教？），并且这部作品在巴赫在世的时候没有被演出过

The B minor Mass and Passions were the works through which Bach was 'rediscovered' and reclaimed for the performing repertoire in the nineteenth century.

弥撒曲中的五个重要部分：Kyrie, Gloria, Credo, Sanctus, Agnus Dei

巴赫是为了赢得 Dresden 的头衔而写的弥撒曲（Dresden 主要的宗教为天主教），但是这部弥撒曲长达两个小时，根本不适合在教堂演奏！(Practical or not practical?)

<font color=blue>Bach, St. John Passion, BWV 245</font>

受难曲和康塔塔一样，是大型的管弦乐和声乐作品（Biblical opera with commentary）

<font color=blue>Bach, St. Matthew Passion, BWV 244</font>

在马太受难曲中也运用了牧歌主义

> Felix Mendelssohn Bartholdy, 1809-1847
>
> "That fair copy passed into Carl Friedrich Zelter's possession and provided the vehicle for Bach's rediscovery and canonization as a musical Founding Father when the 20 year old Felix Mendelssohn, a pupil of Zelter who would have a distinguished career as composer in his own right, conducted a performance of the St. Matthew Passion at the Berlin Singakademie on 11 March 1829, a little over a century after its first performance in Leipzig."

## The Bach Revival

The very aspects of Bach's style had led to his temporary eclipse: **complexity, conservatism, uncompromising religiosity, and asperity**

> The nineteenth-century Bach revival focused mainly on just a few works: the **Passion oratorios**, the **B-minor Mass**, the **Well-Tempered Clavier**, and a few later masterworks of an old-fashioned, abstract nature in which Bach gave full rein to his unrivaled contrapuntal virtuosity. This last group included the ***Goldberg Variations***, a huge cycle of 30 keyboard pieces, including a series of intricate canons, all based on a single 'aria' (ostinato). The ultimate "speculative' work, Bach's intended final testament, was ***Die Kunst Der Fuge*** **("The Art of Fugue", BWV 1080)**. Bach was working on this collection on the day he died.

越抽象，越复杂，越厚重的乐曲越受到十九世纪浪漫主义作曲家的追捧
