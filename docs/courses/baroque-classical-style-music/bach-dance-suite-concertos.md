# Bach's Dance Suites (组曲) and Concertos

> Despite the seemingly cloistered insularity of his career, Bach mastered **all range of contemporary musical idioms**. In part this was simply a matter of being German. At a time when French and Italian musicians were mutually suspicious and much concerned with resisting each other's influence, German musicians tended to define themselves as **universal synthesis**, able to select with due discrimination from the musical tastes of various peoples **what is best in each**, producing a mixed taste which may well be called the **German taste**. Bach became its ultimate, most universal, exponent.

巴赫能够学习到各个不同国家的风格，一个是由于巴赫自己的努力，还有一个也是当时德国的音乐环境造就的

French actually became the court language of Germany, and French dancing became an obligatory social grace at the many mini-Versailleses that dotted the German landscape. 在德语区的人们对法国的文化趋之若鹜，在巴赫之前，就已经有德国的作曲家模仿法国去谱写法国的组曲了

> **Froberger's contribution** was the truly fundamental one: it was he who adopted **a specific sequence of four dances as essential nucleus in all his suites**, setting a precedent that governed the composition of keyboard suites from them on. It is worth emphasizing that Froberger's **core dances** had pretty much gone out of actual ballroom use. They had been sublimated into elevated courtly **listening-music** by the master instrumentalists of France, which meant slowing them down and cramming them full of interesting musical detail that would have been lost on dancers."

德语区的作曲家将舞曲分为主要的和次要的，并且将舞曲变为一种聆听的音乐，不需要考虑舞者的动作和节奏（将舞曲变为一种很有“秩序”的组曲）

Binary Form: A A B B

1. Allemande (阿勒曼德舞曲)
2. Courante (库朗特舞曲)
3. Sarabande (萨拉班德舞曲)
4. Gigue (吉格舞曲)

## J. S. Bach's Suites

巴赫在 Cöthen 工作时，当时他的老板信奉加尔文主义，在教堂中主张不使用音乐，但是这位老板又喜欢世俗音乐，于是在这段期间，巴赫创作了大量的组曲

J. S. Bach only wrote instrumental music between 1717 to 1723 (Sonatas, Concertos, Suites)

*我们在巴赫的作品中会看到 suite, partita, overture, sonata 这些题目，但实际上这些都是组曲，只不过是用不同乐器演奏的*

**Suite**

- ﻿﻿﻿Core dance movements: allemande, courante, sarabande, gigue
- ﻿﻿﻿*Galanteries* ("Galanterien") and other interpolated movements: menuet, bourrée, gavotte, air, anglaise, loure, polonaise, passepied, rondeau, capriccio, burlesca, scherzo, forlane, badinerie

主舞曲在组曲中是一定要按照顺序出现的，其中会穿插一些次要舞曲，gigue 是核心舞曲中的最后一首，必须要放在组曲中的最后一首

在上面这首吉格中，巴赫使用了赋格，并且引入主题倒影，将德国的创作手法放到法国的音乐体裁中！

巴赫将小提琴的四条弦发挥到了极致，每一根弦都代表一个声部！

这首组曲中 chaconne 成为组曲中的最后一首（而不是 gigue）

等到巴赫到 Leipzig 之后，他就开始谱写他的四首管弦乐组曲（因为 Leipzig 当时有一些很著名的铜管乐演奏家），管弦乐组曲相对来说结构不会那么严谨

## J. S. Bach's Concertos

<font color=blue>Bach, Harpsichord Concerto in F minor, BWV 1056</font>

<font color=blue>Italian Concerto, BWV 971</font>

意大利协奏曲中巴赫将整个管弦乐队移植到羽管键盘上！

> "The bracing composition, usually called the "Italian Concerto in English, is a tour de force for composer and performer alike. The compositional feat is the **transfer to a single keyboard instrument** of the whole complex **Italian concertato style**, with its interplay of solo and tutti. A single keyboard instrument is not a single keyboard: large harpsichords, like pipe organs, had double keyboards that controlled different sets of strings. By engaging a device called **a coupler** that made both keyboards respond to a single touch, Bach could achieve a solo/tutti contrast herein keyboards."

通过羽管键琴上的一个叫做 coupler 的装置做出明显的强弱对比，从而模仿 ritornello 和 solo 的差别（巴赫将对管弦乐队的想象移接到键盘乐上）

巴赫也会将即兴的加花放到乐谱中（保守？现代？）

## A Fusion of French, Italian, and German Styles

Brandenburg Concertos (《勃兰登堡协奏曲》): Concerto grosso

> "Bach hoped for an appointment to Brandenburg's court in Berlin. Indeed, several of Bach's best known compositions, in fact, were written or assembled in connection with job-or title-hunting, often unsuccessful; they include his B minor Mass."

Brandenburg Concertos 共有六首，并且每首的乐器编排都不一样

<font color=blue>Concerto No. 5 in D major, BWV 1050</font>

这是一首 concerto grosso，但是听上去像是羽管键琴的独奏协奏曲，巴赫模糊了大协奏曲和独奏协奏曲的边界，并且将羽管键琴的地位提高到一个新的地位（超越了和羽管键琴一起演奏的长笛和小提琴）

Cadenza! The earliest of all solo keyboard concertos! 类似于浪漫主义时期协奏曲中独奏乐器的华彩

*Social transgression?*

> "The final movement of the Fifth Brandenburg Concerto is an excellent example of 'fused' genres. It seems to have a hard time deciding whether it is **a fugue, a gigue, or a concerto**. But of course it is all of those things at once."

<font color=blue>Concerto No. 6 in B-flat major, BWV 1051</font>

NO violin at all! 巴赫将 viola da gamba 这个乐器放入协奏曲中
