# George Frideric Handel: Instrumental Music, Operas, and Oratorios

<font color=blue>Handel, 'Eternal Source of Light Divine' from *Ode for the Birthday of Queen Anne*, HWV 74</font>

<font color=blue>Handel, Passacaglia, Suite No. 7 in G minor HWV 432</font>

上面这首 Passacaglia 具有法国序曲的风格，低音还使用了 walking bass

Johann Sebastian Bach (1685-1750)

George Frideric Handel (1685-1759)

Domenico Scarlatti (1685-1757)

> Handel v.s Bach: "The paradox is that Handel, the worldly spirit, is most characteristically represented in today's repertory by his **vocal music on sacred subjects**, while Bach, the quintessential religious spirit, is largely represented by **secular instrumental works**."

## The Orchestral Suite

The *Water Music* is a collection of dances organized into three suites.

The dances are "stylized" and are structured in conventional forms. (不是用来伴舞的曲子，只是用到了舞蹈的节奏)

《水上音乐》和《皇室烟火》是亨德尔写的纯管弦乐的组曲

<font color=blue>Handel, Music for the *Royal Fireworks* HWV351</font>

## *Opera Seria* (Serious Opera)

正歌剧（between 1710s to 1770s），强调炫技

歌剧的 R 和 S 部分之间的界限变得模糊，R 和 S 部分的冲突，制造矛盾

但是亨德尔在伦敦写「正歌剧」竟写到破产（阉人歌手也不愿意唱亨德尔的作品）！英国的 *Beggar's Opera* (John Gay)

## Handel's Genius!

为了赚钱，亨德尔必须要写其他体裁的曲子！

Whenever opera had encountered obstacles on its Italian home turf, its create energies had found an outlet in **oratorio** (清唱剧).

Oratorio: Biblical operas are presented without staging.

语言很重要（从德语到英语写作）；删除讲话的人；加上很有张力的合唱团

慢慢的，英国也将清唱剧作为能够代表国家精神的一种作品

<center><b>Nationalistic Works</b></center>

> "Handel's oratorios were the first great monumnets in the history of European music to nationallism." (R. Taruskin)

Oratorio: An **oratorio** combines recitatives and arias, with a significant role given to the chorus. The action or "plot" is based on a religious subject; in certain respects, the oratorio is like an unstaged, sacred opera (Biblical operas).

In *Israel in Egypt*, Handel adopts music-dramatic technique—the <font color=red>madrigalist</font> art (the art of musical depiction). Handel's technique in this aspect perhaps even outstripped Vivaldi.

<font color=blue>"Their land brougut forth frogs" from *Israel in Egypt*</font>

用管弦乐模仿青蛙跳动（和 Vivaldi 类似，都是用管弦乐进行模仿，an extended instrumental "palette"）

<font color=blue>"He spake the word" from *Israel in Egypt*</font>

模仿苍蝇和虱子

Entertainment, Immediately to be Understood

像所有的牧歌主义者一样，作曲家们都希望通过幽默的方式让听众能够马上了解自己想表达的东西

<font color=blue>Handel, 'Hallelujah' from *Messiah*</font>

*Messiah* 本来不是为了所谓的宗教功能，是一个世俗的清唱剧，但是由于其主题的特殊性，常常在圣诞节以及庄重的场合演出，被误解为是一个神圣的宗教乐曲—"**consecrated**" (圣化)

音乐厅变成一个圣化的场域，仪式性&美丽的误解

> "The continuous performing tradition of European art (or literate) music can therefore be said to begin with Messiah, **the first "classic" in our contemporary repertoire**, and Handel is therefore the earliest of all 'perpetually-in-repertory' (classical) composers."

*Messiah* 可以算是第一个传承下来的的古典乐曲（被广泛演奏）

<center>Parody ("Borrowing")</center>

Handel was the champion of all parodists (仿作者), adapting both his own works and those of other composers in unprecedented numbers and with unprecedented exactness.

亨德尔在世的时候就受到“抄袭”的质疑和批判

<font color=blue>Handel, "For unto us a child is born" from *Messiah*</font>

上面这部分旋律选自亨德尔自己之前写的一首有关情爱的清唱剧（*Aminta e Fillide*, 描述男女之间的缠绵），但是却放在弥赛亚中一个很神圣的片段。。？"Despite its embodying the sacredest of themes, it was an **entertainment**, and its music was designed to amuse a public in search of diversion, however edifying."

<font color=blue>Handel, "But who may abide the day of His coming" from *Messiah*</font>

这一段在当时是写给阉人歌手的一个唱段，即使当时英国人不喜欢女性化的阉人歌手，而且 Handel 也找到除了 Farinelli 以外的其他阉人歌手为他来演唱这一段——报仇！

> "Handel was getting his own back in many ways. By hiring the latest divine "*ragazzo*" or Italian boy, **he was getting his own back against Farinelli**, who had so disastrously snubbed him. By scoring such a hit with his new *aria di bravura* he was vindicating the exotic entertainments he had ben forced so long ago to give up. And by making the British public love the **infusion of Italian manners** into the quintessential British spectacle, he may have been taking a sweetly secret personal revenge on the stolid tastemakers who had forced him to deny his predilections in more ways than one—for as many scholars now agree, **Handel, a lifelong bachelor, was probably what we would now call a closeted gay man.**"
