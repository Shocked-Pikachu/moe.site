# 从蒙特威尔第的牧歌到蒙特威尔第的歌剧

<center><i>"Monteverdi was the creator of modern music."</i></center>

巴洛克时期初期有单声歌曲的潮流和风格，但是复调写作在巴洛克时期仍是一直存在的，只不过加入了一些单声歌曲的特点

## Monteverdi's Madrigals

蒙特威尔第一生一共完成了九部牧歌

"Monodic Revolution" (Solo singing with accompaniment)

> By the time Monteverdi composed the *Lagrime d'amante (Lover's Tears)*, even Monteverdi's polyphonic style had been touched by the monodic stile recitativo.

蒙特威尔第因为嫌工资太少于是搬去了威尼斯……

### Sixth Book

*A cppella + stile recitative*

**Last non-continuo composition**

<font color=blue>Monteverdi, *Incentrite spoglie* ("Ashen Remains") from *Sestina Lagrime d'amante al Sepolcro dell' amatta* ("A lover's tears at his beloved's grave", 1610. from the **Sixth Book**)</font>

### Seventh Book

1. Unstaged monody 单声歌曲（模仿讲话的旋律，音域范围比较狭窄）
2. Music for staging in the theater of mind

<font color=blue>Monteverdi, *Lettera Amorosa* (“Love Letter”), from the **Seventh Book**</font>

### Eighth Book 1

*Stile concitato* ("agitated style") 激动风格

蒙特威尔第的牧歌主义实际上还相当鲜明

<font color=blue>Monteverdi, *Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda* ("The Combat of Tancredi and Clorinda" from the **Eighth Book**)</font>

### Eighth Book 2

Indexical Signification: <font color=red>**Lament**, descending tetrachord (minor mode, chaconne bass)</font>

这种下行四度的音阶模拟人的悲叹，这种印象一直延续到之后很多的作曲家（一般曲子为小调）<u>非常重要！！</u>

*Chaconne（恰空）：有一个固定的音形代表的和声在持续不断的进行；可以说 Lament 是一种独特的 Chaconne*

<font color=blue>Monteverdi, *Lamento della Ninfa* ("Nymph's lament" from the **Eighth Book**)</font>

> "There was a new sort of dramatic or representational connection: a musical idea that is **independent of any image** of the poem, that does not portray the nymph's behavior iconically or hook up with any observable model in nature; a musical idea associated with a literary one, in short, **not through mimesis or direct imitation but by mere agreement among composers and listeners**."

<font color=blue>Led Zeppelin, *Babe I'm Gonna Leave You*</font>

<font color=blue>The Beatles, *While My Guitar Gently Weeps*</font>

<font color=blue>Green Day, *Brain Stew*</font>

现在的摇滚乐也会用到这样的下行四度音阶的声音，不过可能在其中会添加一些半音以增加音乐的色彩（可见蒙特威尔第影响之深远）

> "By the time of his accession to the post in **1601 [at Mantua]** he had already published **four books of madrigals** and had already been famously attacked by a conservative music theorist name Giovanni Maria Artusi (阿图西) for harmonic liberties in madrigals that would eventually be published in his next book (1603). The controversy enhances his reputation enormously, especially when he joined in himself, first in the preface to his **Fifth Book** of Madrigals (1605). Two years later—in **1607**, the year of *Orfeo*—Monteverdi fully responded to his critics."

<center><span style="color: red; font-style: italic">Seconda pratica</span> (the "second practice", <i>stile moderno</i>) 第二实践</center>
<center>"make the words the mistress of the music and not the servant"</center>
<center><b>v.s.</b></center>
<center><span style="color: red; font-style: italic">Prima pratica</span> (the "first practice", <i>stile antico</i>) 第一实践</center></center>

> "Recognized by his contemporaries as the most gifted and interesting composer in Italy, Monteverdi became the spokesman and the scape goat of the new manner of composing, i.e., *seconda practica*."

第一实践强调音乐的重要性（即使在描述使用悲惨的语言，音乐也应该优美，音乐>文字）；第二实践强调音乐服务文字（文字>音乐）

蒙特威尔第并不是简单的用第二实践取代第一实践，而是将两种风格相结合

## "Madrigalisms" or Word-Painting

<font color=blue>Monteverdi, [*Zefiro torna*](./Zefiro torna.pdf)</font>

"...striking musical images, evoking the text almost literally"

1. Sound: breezes, sweet accents, murmuring, sweet sound, music, harmony, sonorous caves
2. Voice: weeping, singing: groaning, sighing, moaning, speaking, debating
3. Image: foot, wave, green leaves, flowers dancing, fields, heads garlanded, mountains and deep valleys, caves, the sua rising at dawn, golden radiance, light, silver, cerulean mantle, abandoned woods, fire of the eyes
4. Action: breezes animate a landscape, young women dance, sound echoes in caves, the sun rises and spreads its light; the speaker wanders alone through abandoned woods
5. Dramatic situation: the speaker is alone and tormented by thoughts of love, desire, and loss, beautifal dawn even though the world beyond the abandoned woods is celebrating with song, dance, and a beautiful dawn

## Monteverdi's Operas

有些学者认为 Musical Tales are NOT Opera. 佩里和卡契尼的作品中有大量的单声歌曲部分，而蒙特威尔第的作品中有大量的舞蹈，因此蒙特威尔第的作品才算得上真正的歌剧

歌剧中的三个要素：

- Monody
- Chorus
- Dance

### 从宫廷写作模式到商业写作模式

两种模式是非常不一样的，可以看到蒙特威尔第两种不同场域下写出作品风格之不同

1607—Monteverdi's *Orfeo* premieres in **Mantua** (宫廷写作)

1642-43—Monteverdi's *The Coronation of Poppea* premieres in **Venice** (商业写作)

### _L'Orfeo_ (1607)

> "The early musical plays, of which Monteverdi's *Orfeo* was the crowning stroke, are characterized as the capital artistic expression of the twin triumphs of political absolutism and economic mercantilism, an expression that brought to its pinnacle the traditional explorations of the arts as a **'means of representing power'**."

“权力”是歌剧需要最终展示的东西

1. **The fusion of all the arts** in the common enterprise of princely **aggrandizement**. The **monster assemblages of singers and instrumentalists** were matched, and even exceeded, by the **luxuriously elaborate stage sets and theatrical machinery**. (各种乐器和人声一起编排进歌剧)
2. The plots involved **mythological or ancient historical heroes** caught up in stereotyped conflicts of love and honor, were transparent <font color=blue><u>allegories</u></font> of the sponsoring rulers, who were address directly, as we know, in the obligatory prologues that linked the story of the opera to the event of their reign. (神话故事的改编)
3. **The ban on virtuosity** reflected the old aristocratic prejudice, inherited from Aristotle. (Caccini, moderate, intimate, elegantly applied throat-music called Borgia, comparable in some ways with the intimate style of singing known in the 20th century as <font color=blue><u>crooning</u></font>). (禁止使用炫技)

阿波罗从天而降—展示技术的先进和布景的奢华（阿波罗代表宫廷中权力最大的角色）

Toccata: a quasi-military fanfare（欢腾的器乐曲，用于开场乐，和歌剧本身没有太大关系，只是用于排场和迎接重要宾客）

奥菲欧中也有丰富的编舞—也是权力和金钱的展现

**Chorus**: comments on the action as it unfolds Greek *khoros*. (类似于古希腊悲剧中的合唱团，在合适的时间对歌剧进行评论)

### *L'incoronazione di Poppea* (1643)

威尼斯的第一个公开的歌剧院：Teatro di San Cassiano, the first ever public opera house built in Venice, 1637

**Historical fantasy** (大众比较喜欢历史故事而不是神话故事)

"For the greater enjoyment of the paying public" - Poppea: celebrating vice triumph and mocking virtue

在这部歌剧中，**美声唱法**开始出现，旋律比较悠扬而不是单声歌曲那种单调的旋律

这部歌剧中用到了 Lament 的技巧，但是展现的情绪是很开心的（调性和我们之前听到的不太一样，可能是暗示 Poppea 的开心是建立在别人的痛苦之上）—Subverting all moral and political codes

返始咏叹调（da capo aria, ABA）

注意因为这部歌剧是商业化的，所以需要优美的声音和优美的旋律（有人认为这是蒙特威尔第的学生写的歌剧，但是即使如此我们也可以看到歌剧从宫廷模式到商业模式的转变）

**喜剧**

**炫技**

> "Not surprisingly, **virtuosity** found a natural home in the commercial music theater. It is only one of the reasons for regarding the Venetian Teatro San Cassiano and the year of **1637**, not the Florentine Palazzo Patti or the year 1597, as the true time and place of the birth of opera as we know it now..From now one, the word opera will mean the **commercial opera**."

Seventeenth and eighteenth century serious opera is unthinkable without *castrati* (去势男高音、阉人歌手)—受到市场的追捧，有阉人歌手的歌剧票房普遍会很高，阉人歌手往往追求高音和炫技（美声唱法），有时作曲家也要服从于这些歌手的安排
