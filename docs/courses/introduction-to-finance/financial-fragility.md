# Financial Fragility

## Bank Runs Occur Repeatedly through Financial History

**Bank runs**: when large numbers of depositors withdraw funds at the same time due to concerns about the health of a bank

Why do bank runs occurs? How can we prevent them?

## Diamond and Dybvig (1983) Model of Bank Runs

DD (1983) showed how the maturity mismatch (duration mismatch) of bank's assets and liabilities makes them susceptible to runs

Three central assumptions underpin the model:

1. Productive investments have long horizons (**illiquid** in the short rum)
2. Consumers may urgently need funds, or may be able to wait
3. Banks cannot identity whether an individual will need immediate access to funds until a deposit is withdrawn

Beliefs and self-fulfilling runs: The bank fails if beliefs turn sour

## Measures to Prevent Runs

1. **Suspension of convertibility**: It doesn't work quite well (The bank does not know how many depositors truly need cash)
2. **Lender of last resort**: LoLR never actually lends, the backstop is what matters. In reality the central bank plays this role
3. **Deposit insurance**: The insurance does not guarantee all deposits, so that depositors will monitor the bank

Implicit Insurance (Too big to Fail)
