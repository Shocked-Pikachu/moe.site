# Historical Returns on Risky Portfolios

## Nominal Return and Real Return

$$
r=\frac{1+i}{1+\pi}-1\approx i-\pi\nonumber
$$

Where $\pi$ is the inflation rate, $r$ is the real return, and $i$ is the nominal return

## Example: Inflation and Returns of Government Bond

Expectation, standard deviation

Dispersion of bonds: does not reflect risk of the security, but rather the changes in the *risk-free* rate over time.

## Risk Premium

Risk premium: the *expected* HPR on a risky asset and the risk-free rate.

Treasure-bonds may have risks (changes in risk-free rate overtime)

**Excess return**: the difference between the *actual* rate of return on a risky asset and the risk-free rate.

Excess return can be considered as the additional profits provided for the investors in order to attract them on riskier financial products.

Obviously, the expected value of **excess return** is **risk premium**.
