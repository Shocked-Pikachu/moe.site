# Stock Market Indexes

## Stock Price Indexes

+ Price weighted indexes (do not consider the scale of corporations)
+ Value weighted indexes

## Stock Splits

Share price halves, shares outstanding doubled

Price weighted indexes must be adjusted >> Adjust the denominator after stock split

# Funds

Small investors face many problems, and investment companies allow them to circumvent these problems.

## Types of Investment Fund

**Open-end funds**: the amount of funds may change

**Closed-end funds**: the amount of funds are fixed

**Exchanged-traded funds (ETFs)**: combine the best features of open-end and closed-end funds.

## Open-End Funds

Net Asset Value = (Market value of asset - Liability) / Shares Outstanding

Mutual funds / Hedge funds

Migration to index funds and ETFs (passive funds)

## Closed-End Funds

CEF raises money in an IPO

Shares are **not redeemable** - exit by selling to other investors

Share price may deviate from NAV - *premium / discount*

Closed-end funds usually trade at a *persistent discount* to their NAV. (WHY?)

## ETFs

Exchanged-traded funds

- can redeem before the fund maturity
- can trade freely on the secondary market
