# Allocating Resources Over Time

## Time Value of Money

**Interest rate** represents the time value of fund in the equilibrium.

**General equilibrium:**

+ Surplus unit is the fund *supplier*.
+ Deficit unit is the fund *demander*.
+ In equilibrium, the fund supplied meets the fund demanded (The same mechanism as market price. Interest rate is the relative "price" of today's funds and tomorrow's funds).

## Compounding, Future Value and Present Value

Discounting future values back to the present

## Annuity and Perpetuity

APR (Annual Percentage Rate) and EFF (Effective Annual Rate)

$APR = {\rm period\ rate\times number\ of\ periods\ per\ year}$â€‹

$EFF=(1+\frac{APR}{m})^m-1$, where $m$ is the number of periods per year

APR does not take into account the compounding of interest within a specific year (simple interest)

## Nominal and Real Interest Rate

Real interest rate is what a decision maker should really care about, since it represents the amount of consumption goods one has to sacrifice for investment or saving

By definition, real interest rate is approximately the differencebetween interest rate and inflation rate

i\approx \pi+r
