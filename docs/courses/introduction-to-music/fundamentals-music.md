# Fundamentals of Music

## Understanding Music

"I don't understand anything about music"?

"**Understanding music** simply means that we find some of it orderly rahter than chaotic, pleasant rather than unpleasant, predictable rather than unpredictable, meaningful rather than meaningless; and familiar rather than unfamiliar."

## Explaining Music!

**Explaining music** refers to the creation of statments, descriptions, classifications, labels, analyses, interpretations, and theories of causes and effects that account in words for particular musical phenomena.

**Listening and Repeated Listening:** One can't get this kind of understanding of music by reading about music.

The purpose of "understanding" music:

1. Enjoyment
2. Intellectual Reward
3. Aesthetic Reward
4. Ethical Reward

## Five Questions

- What is it?
- How does it work?
- What does it mean?
- What is its history?
- Where do I go from here?

### What is it?

<font color=red>Genres</font> are included in the Categories:

1. Classical music (ex. <font color=red>the symphony</font>)
2. Jazz
3. World music (ex. <font color=red>Japanes *Sokyoku*, chamber music</font>)
4. American popular music (ex. <font color=red>rock, metal, punk, EDM, hip-hop, <u>country</u></font>)
5. Chinese popular music

事实上，genre 和 category 有时不会区分的非常清楚，不同人对于这两个词的理解是不一样的。Category, genre, style 这些词的使用都和使用的人相关，但一般来讲，category 是 genre 的上位名词，genre 是 style 的上位名词

Style 不仅仅是音乐本身的特性，有时也会延伸到音乐的表达方式和传播渠道（如 K-pop 的舞蹈）

"Distinguishing among category, genre, and style is very tricky."

Definition (history, institution, critics)

### How does it work?

#### Musical Tones

**Musical Tones** (Overtone structure, pitch, duration, envelope, and loudness)

Overtone (泛音, 泛音列) (<u>harmonic</u> series or <u>overtone</u> series)

我们之所以可以区分不同乐器的音色，是因为不同乐器发声时的泛音列不一样，若我们将乐器的所有泛音都去除，那么我们听到的声音就是一样的

*Mongolian Khoomi (呼麦) 就是一种通过调整基音和泛音关系来实现一个人唱出两个音的效果*

<font color=red><u>Musicians combine musical tones in a nearly infinite variety of ways.</u></font> To understand how they do this, to explain “how the music works,” requires the use of a somewhat specialized vocabulary. These terms break music down into its composite <font color=red>"elements"</font>.

1. Timbre
2. Texture
3. Rhythm
4. Melody
5. Harmony
6. Form
7. Performance techniques

#### Timbre

Hornbostel-Sachs 分类法（五种不同的乐器）：体鸣乐器、膜鸣乐器、弦鸣乐器、气鸣乐器和电子乐器

#### Texture

1. Monophonic Texture (one sound) 单音织度
2. Polyphonic Texture (many sounds) 复音织度
3. Biphony (with drone) 双声织度
4. Heterophony 支声复调
5. Homophony 主调

*支声复调在中国传统的丝竹乐队中是很常见的，看似各个声部都在进行统一种旋律，但是实际上不同乐器的旋律是不同的，而不同旋律之间会有比较微小的变化*

主调音乐在现在的音乐中是非常常见的织度，我们在听主调音乐的时候，曲式结构主要应该关注旋律部分，和声的变化是服务于旋律的

#### Rhythm

*上面七种 elements 不一定在所有的音乐中都会用到，例如第五个和声在非西方古典的音乐中可能就不会用到，但是第三条节奏在所有音乐中都一定会出现*

**Meter** refers to the organization of the pulsation or the beat of tones (duple/triple meter).

**Syncopation** (切分音) refers to the accenting of notes that are typically not emphasized, creating a rhythm that is often described as "off-beat."

<font color=blue>Scott Joplin, "Maple Leaf Rag" (Ragtime, 散拍爵士)</font>

Nonmetrical music lacks a beat or pulse 像念唱一般，难以听出其中的拍子

#### Melody

Vertical dimension (range)

Melodic shape: ascending, descending, undulating, and flat (contour)

Melodic Character: Scales 不同的文化中有不同的音阶

- Major: bright cheerful
- Minor: subdued, sad
- Pentatonic music
- Arabic scale (*maqam rast*)
- Indonesian scale (*pelog*)

#### Harmony

Two or more simultaneously sounding pitches is called a **chord**

#### Form

Form refers to the "shape" of a muscial performance as it unfolds through time from beginning to end

曲式是一个作品的结构，将作品的不同部分连接起来，包括重复、变奏等

*一般来说，儿童、民谣这类音乐因为需要让人易于记忆和传播，所以重复度往往较高，我们经常在一首作品中听到同一旋律一直被重复*

Sonata Form (奏鸣曲式, 19th-century three-part scheme):

Exposition (I-V) - Development (x-V) - Recapitulation (I-I)

旋律和和声可能在重复的时候都会有一些小小的改变，我们在聆听的时候（尤其是西方音乐）要同时关注旋律和和声的变化

#### Performance Technique

除了纸面上能够分析的音乐要素，演奏者的演奏技巧在音乐的呈现中也是非常重要的！

> **Assignment 1**
>
> Explain "why you like a particular song or genre of music?" (1) the way it expresses your social identity (class, race, ethnicity, gender) or in terms of the way it reflects your worldview (culture) (2) Describe how it works.

### What does it mean?

Music is a type of art and entertainment made up of musical tones and the seven musical elements outlined above. But music also is a human behavior with deep psychological, cultural, social, economic, and political significance. In this book we interpret the meaning of music in seven categories:

1. aesthetics
2. emotional resonance
3. cultural linkages
4. social behaviors
5. political action
6. economic activity
7. use of technology

The meaning of music is not conveyed by language signs but by two other types of signs: **indexes** (索引) and **icons** (图标)

音乐符号和个人经历以及社会文化的关系很大，而且和语言不一样的是，音乐符号的稳定性不高，随着时间流逝，音乐的符号可能发生很大的改变

*IS MUSIC A UNIVERSAL LANGUAGE? Maybe NOT!*

<u>Index</u>: If we can't link a musical performance to something in our **previous experience**, then it will probably have no emotional effect on us at all

<u>Icon</u>: In symphonic music, for example, a fast, low-pitched drum beat and a cymbal crash can be icons of thunder and lightning, which the composer may hope will generate a compouding feeling of dread in the listener

音乐是文化的表达 cultural linkage/expression，在不同的文化语境中音乐会产生不同的 index 和 icon，而音乐所牵涉到的社会行为也会不同（古典音乐厅和乐队的演出现场？）

> "As to the Chinanman's voice, nothing so strange had ever struck my ear. Imagine a series of nasal, guttural, and hideous tones, which I may without too great exaggeration compare to the sounds a dog makes when after a long sleep it stretches its limbs and yawns."

### What is its history?

"Each gateway recording is also explained by its history. That history includes the origins of the genre or style it represents, the social and cultural conditions that produced the particular work in the past, and the history of that music since it was first created."

### Where do I go from here?

listening to audio recordings, watching videos, doing some additional reading...
