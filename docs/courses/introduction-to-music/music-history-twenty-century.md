# Music History During the Long Twentieth Century

## American Jazz and Symphony

"Real America": Symphonic Jazz

George Gershwin (1898-1937)

"Jazz I regard as an American folk-music not the only one, but a very powerful one which is probably in the blood and feeling of the American people more than any other style of folk-music" (Gershwin, 1933)

音乐变得程式化（便于商业推广）：AABA 模式

格什温在历史上第一个享受到工业化录音复制的福利，成为了史上最富有的音乐家

Darius Milhaud (1892-1974), Maurice Ravel (1875-1937) 有很多古典的作曲家也受到了美国爵士音乐的影响（主要还是法国人）

用交响乐（来自德奥音乐）这种壳来装进爵士乐，从而拔高爵士乐的地位

Icebreaker: 《蓝色狂想曲》一开始的单簧管起到了一个暖场的作用

《蓝色狂想曲》中有很多地方都按照 AABA 的模式来写（每个部分占 4 小节）

## Javanese Court Music

Javanese Court Music (1600-1750) and Balinese Gamelan (1890-1918)

Religious background - FOUR TYPES

1. Animism
2. Hinduism
3. Islam
4. Christianity

虽然印尼现在国内的宗教以伊斯兰教为主，但是 Gamalan 有很强的 Hinduism 色彩

爪哇宫廷音乐：下面是一首非常有名的曲子，其曲名包含了节奏、拍子、调式等等信息

和中国/日本的宫廷音乐一样，爪哇的宫廷音乐速度也较慢，且有一定的仪式感，但是爪哇宫廷音乐的音色（以金属打击乐为主）和中国/日本宫廷音乐大相径庭

<font color=blue>*Ketawang Puspawarna Laras Slendro Patet Manyura*</font>

- *Ketawang* is a musical form based on a rhythmic cycle of 16 beats
- *Puspawarna* is the name of this composition in the *ketawang* form: it means "kinds of flowers"
- *Laras* means tuning system
- *Slendro* is one of two tuning systems in Javanese music: it has five approximately equidistant pitches in an octave
- *Patet*, also *pathet*, means melodic mode
- *Manyura* is one of three melodic modes in the *slendro* tuning system

**Gamelan** (加美兰): A generic term for a diverse class of mainly **percussion-dominated** musical ensembles found on Bali, Java, and other Indonesian islands

### How does it work?

(Quasi-)Polyphonic texture

加美兰的音乐特别注重节奏的循环，并且具有阶级性的层次感（layers and cycles）

Three layers in Gamelan's texture (slow, mid, fast tempo)

Colotomy: Rhythmic Structure

The rhythmic stress is at the **end** of the cycle—In Western music, we speak of "downbeats." With Gamelan, can we speak of "endbeats"?

Two tuning system (听上去像是没有调整的五声音阶)

1. *slendro*: five-tone equidistant pentatonic scale
2. *pelog*: seven-tone heptatonic system from which five (but sometimes six or seven) main pitches are chosen

### What does it mean?

"The forty or so bronze instruments of a gamelan are not owned by individuals, as most instruments of the European orchestra are. Rather, the entire orchestra is owned by a prince, a wealthy individual, a broadcasting company, or a music conservatory. New owners commission the making of all the instruments as a set and place them in their palace, home, or institution"

Gamelan and shadow puppet show 加美兰给皮影戏伴奏

"Puspawarna" seems to float along without any dramatic changes. It does not get louder or softer, although it slows down and speeds up gradually. It doesn't modulate to other scales or modes. It goes in a circle rhythmically. This floating quality of gamelan music impressed the French composer Claude Debussy (1862–1918) when he heard a Javanese gamelan at a **World's Fair in Paris** in 1889. At the end of the nineteenth century and the beginning of the twentieth century European composers were seeking alternatives to the very directed nature of European tonal music, which moves through a series of chord progressions and key areas from the tonic key to other keys to the dominant key and back to the tonic key.

对于爪哇加美兰的支持，除了西方的各个具有民族音乐学研究的大学以外，日惹（Yogyakarta, 印度尼西亚爪哇中南部特区）作为印尼中相对独立的一个王国也是特别多的

旅行者金唱片（the Golden Record）共有 27 首作品，而第二首就是爪哇的加美兰——加美兰在世界民族音乐中有特别重要的音乐，被看作是世界音乐的宝藏

## Balinese Gamelan

在伊斯兰教取代印度教的时候，许多爪哇岛的居民都搬迁到巴厘岛，而巴厘岛也传承了爪哇的加美兰音乐。荷兰入侵巴厘岛时，受到了巴厘岛人民的强烈反抗，巴厘岛的人们为了不被羞辱，甚至会举行集体自杀的仪式

In the area of culture and music the *puputans* (mass ritual suicide) had three important consequences

1. The Dutch government decided to support the arts in Bali and turn the island into a tourist destination, which it remains today
2. Gamelan orchestras moved from the now-defunct courts into village social life, where *sekaha* devoted to music, theater, and dance became the sources of patronage
3. A new genre of music emerged—gamelan *gong kebyar*

爪哇和巴厘岛的加美兰是比较不同的：爪哇的加美兰有一种宫廷音乐的高贵感，而巴厘岛的加美兰速度较快，且情绪较为激动

### How does it work?

"The gongs and metallophones of gamelan *gong kebyar* are made in pairs to have a slight difference in pitch between the gongs or keys of the two instruments in each pair. Each pair of instruments is thought of as male and female, with female instru ments having the slightly lower pitch. This differ ence in pitch causes a beating effect that is called *ombak* , which means “waves.” The speed of the beati ng is designed to be absolutely consistent over the entire range of the orchestra. Without *ombak* , the sound is considered dead."

巴厘岛加美兰也是复调织体，讲究声部之间的层级关系

有趣的事，巴厘岛的加美兰会将乐器的同一个音故意调得有一些不准，从而制造出“拍”的声响

Gamelan *gong kebyer* (克比亚加美兰) is one of the most frequently performed types of gamelan in Bali—和爪哇岛不同，加美兰不再是雅乐，而是岛民们真正日常能够接触到的音乐

"Today, the main settings for gamelan performance are rituals that mark either the life cycle (e.g., marriages, birthdays, cremations) or temple festivals. Gamelan performances also occur on national holidays, for village events like fundraisers, and in presentation for **tourists**."

爪哇和巴厘岛加美兰的不同之处：

Java (moderate)

- Gamelan Sekaten
- Gamelan Degung

Bali (edgy, fiery)

- Gamelan *Gambang*
- Gamelan *Gong Kebyar*

**Precision**: With the dozens of musicians required to perform gamelan, often in cooperation with dancers and puppeteers, the performing arts in Bali are almost always communal efforts. This is an expression of the value Balinese society places on cooperation and community spirit. (从荷兰入侵殖民时巴厘岛岛民的强烈抗争行为中也可以看出来这种团结性)

**TOURISM**: Tourism has generated more revenue and interest in all forms of gamelan, inspired the composition of even more new repertoire, stimulated the creation of new ensembles, and encouraged the revival of pieces that had become nearly obsolete. 在巴厘岛，加美兰是受到大量支持的——特别是为了旅游业，巴厘岛的人们希望旅游的游客们能够接受他们当地的音乐（许多酒店、机场等场所的背景音乐就是加美兰）

**Voice Gamelan & Processional Gamelan**—"Soundscape of Bali": Baliese Gamelan

Bali's vocal Gamelan: *Kecak* (克差)

1. The musical roots of *Kecak* are based on an ancient trance ritual (*Sanghyang Dedari*)
2. Invented in 1930s as a form of dance drama (by Balinese musicians and the German painter Walter Spies)
3. Stories are based on Hindu epic (*Ramayana* epic)
4. Onomatopoeic syllables (拟声词)
5. Electrifying polyrhythmic sound (rhythmic chant)
6. Historical process: change of ritual (*trance* to performance)

*Beleganjur*: cremation procession in Bali

1. Hindu beliefs: cremation of the dead, reincarnation, cyclical concept of time (blending of Hinduism and Buddhism)
2. World View: three worlds (Gods, Balinese people, and evil spirits)
3. Gamelan *Beleganjur*: cremation procession which symbolized the battle between humans and evil spirits

## Hybrid Music in the 20th and 21st Centuries

"Crossing and hybridization of traditional was taking place within Western music as well as between Western and non-Western traditions."

### The Tango: Argentina

A combination of African rhythm, European instruments, musical form, and compositional technique

探戈中的代表性乐器：手风琴（bandoneon）

- Quadruple meter (X x x x), emphasized in the bass; may be superimposed with (x x x X) or (x x X x), creating syncopation
- The use of *staccato* (short, articulate, clipped sound)

Astor Piazzolla (1921-1992): 将脚上的探戈音乐变为音乐厅中的探戈 ("listening tango", a form intended not for dancing, but for the concert hall)

### The Dialogue with the Past

**Retrospection** and **Innovation**

Arvo Pärt (b. Estonia, 1935) 模仿格里高利圣咏（宗教音乐）进行复调作品的创作—holy minimalism

<font color=blue>*Cantus in Memoriam Benjamin Britten* (《纪念布瑞顿之歌》, 1977/80)</font>
